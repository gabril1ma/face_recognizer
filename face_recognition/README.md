# A Python __face recognizer__ 

## First of all:

you need to change the roots of the folders on line 9, 15 of the faces_train.py file AND line 7, 19 of the facerecognition.py file

## Second:
you need to run the faces_train.py so it trains the program to recognize the faces at the "jogadores" folder 

after this it will create for you the files with the code for the analized images

## Finally 
its just select the image you want to test at line 19 of the facerecognition.py and run the program 


** I had to reduce the number of images that were originally in the jogadores folder because github doesnt accept more than 100 archives **
