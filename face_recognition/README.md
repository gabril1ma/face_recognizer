# A Python __face recognizer__ 

1. ## First of all:

  1. you need to change the roots of the folders on line _9_, _15_ of the __faces_train.py__ file __AND__ line _7_, _19_ of the __facerecognition.py__ file

2. ## Second:
  1. you need to run the __faces_train.py__ so it trains the program to recognize the faces at the _jogadores_ folder 

  2. after this it will create for you the files with the code for the analized images

3. ## Finally 
  1. its just select the image you want to test at line _19_ of the __facerecognition.py__ and run the program 


** I had to reduce the number of images that were originally in the _jogadores_ folder because github doesnt accept more than 100 archives **
